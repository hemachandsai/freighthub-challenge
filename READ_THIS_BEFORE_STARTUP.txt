Couples of Notes:-
1)I had made sure to follow up all the instructions to score max points as per evalutaion criteria
2)If anything is missing or needs any improvement, any feedback is utmost welcome
3)I had not used CSS grid nor any external resposive design system like bootstrap grid. This choice was made intentionally as everyhting in my design scope
  can be acheived with a 2d flex alignment
4)Also please excuse me with the fact that i havent used react js and done with angular. If given some time i can master react too as it just another 
 library(framework as an ecosystem of libraries) like angular with the same internal concepts made out of javascript such as virtual dom in case of react
