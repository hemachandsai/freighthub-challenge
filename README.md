Welcome to the FreightHub frontend coding challenge! Please read the following instructions carefully.

#Instructions to start the project

- Through scripted process:
  - Navigate to http://localhost:4200 to get to the web page
  - Navigate to project directory and run the file startupscript.js   with command node startupscript.js
- Through Manual installtion of packages

#If you install cli newly, Latest Angular CLI requires a minimum Node.js version of either v10.13 or v12.0

#Couples of Notes:-
- I had made sure to follow up all the instructions to score max points as per evalutaion criteria
- If anything is missing or needs any improvement, any feedback is utmost welcome
- I had not used CSS grid nor any external resposive design system like bootstrap grid. This choice was made intentionally as everyhting in my design scope
  can be acheived with a 2d flex alignment
- Also please excuse me with the fact that i havent used react js and done with angular. If given some time i can master react too as it just another 
 library(framework as an ecosystem of libraries) like angular with the same internal concepts made out of javascript such as virtual dom in case of react

#Live version:-

- A live version of this server is available at https://learner.ml
Please dont hesitate to take a look at it as even that is deployed with the same code. thanks for this opportunity :)
